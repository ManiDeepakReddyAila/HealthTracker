# Overview

This project highlights the focus on advanced medical devices developed by  following the software engineering principles as laid down by IEC 62304. The aim of this project is to collect userâ€™s workout information from their Apple Health application and enhance their health and fitness goals. Personalized Health Coach is an application that provides insights into userâ€™s health data and enables to do a question-answering about their workout activities

- Monitoring progress - Without right tools and insights, it is not easy to monitor if you are reaching your daily targets.
- Complexity in accessing data - It is hectic to always go back to your past data and search for any information you want.


# Solution  ðŸŽ¯

 - ðŸ’¡ The system collects data from Apple Health application and converts to easily readable format for further analysis.
 - ðŸ’¡ By creating right visualisations, it is easy for the users to view their progress and set targets for various activities such as running and swimming.
 - ðŸ’¡ Users can track their daily progress against set targets, providing feedback on their performance and motivation to achieve their goals.
 - ðŸ’¡ A chatbot interface allows users to query their health data, providing instant access to information.
